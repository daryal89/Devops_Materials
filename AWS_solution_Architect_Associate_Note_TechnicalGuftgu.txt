DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS is a host Name to IP address Translation service
- It is an application layer Protocol
- Previously, all the host name were saved in host.txt file.
- 6 Top level domains included - .com, .org, .biz, .mil, .net & .edu.
- Forword and reverse DNS lookups.
- Higlhly Targeted for Hacking Purpose.
- It uses TCP port 53 and UDP port 53.
- Today, DNS support 13 Root Name Server (A to M)

Note: There are two ways to resolve hostname to IP address. The first is building by a host table on each routers, and the second is to build a DNS server.

Types of Domain
Generic: .net, .edu, .org, .mil, .com, .net

Country: .us, .uk, .in, .np

Inverse:  (Ip to domain Name Mapping)

A Namespace Map each address to a unique Name.
 Namespace: Flat, Hierarchical

Flat Namespace: In this method, Name is assigned to an address. It is in sequence of character without any structure.
- Can't be used in large System.

Hierarchical Namespace: In this method, Name is made of several paths. In this method, Name space can be decentralized.

Hierarcy of Name Servers:

Root Name Server: It is contacted by name servers that cannot resolve the name. It contatcts top level servers if name mapping is not known. It then gets the mapping and return the IP address to the host.

Top Level Server: It is responsible for .com, .org. .edu etc and all top level contry domain like uk, us, fr, ca, in.
They have information about Authoritative domain Servers and known names and IP address of each authoritative name server for the second level  domains.

Authoritative Name Server: It can be maintained by organizaton or service provider. In order to reach ccna.tg.in we have to ask the root DNS server, then it will point out to the top level domain server and then to authoritative domain name server which actually contains the IP address so the autoritative server will return the assocative IP address.

Subnetting:
IPv4 is limited.
Network within a Network is called subnetting. Logically division of IP addresses.
Router's in each interface Network ID should be different.
Router is Internetworking device.
Switch is an device that is used for communication in the same network.

Class A Default CIDR: x.0.0.0/8
Class B Default CIDR: x.x.0.0/16
Class C Default CIDR: x.x.x.0/24

Steps for Network subnetting:
1. For class c network id: 197.10.10.0 (default subnet mask 255.255.255.0)

2. Convert the host in binary
	197.10.10.00000000

3. 2^n -2 >= maximum value of host in network 40 of the router  (n = number of bits of host)
         n=1,2,3,4,5,6 ...
	2^6-2 = 64-2 =62>=40
	n=6

4. Give the remainder to network (8-6 =2) network bit=1, host bit =0.
	   197.10.0.00000000
	   197.10.0.11000000

Find the decimal value and add them up it will give the subnet mask.

Lecture 4: Types of EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute):
- Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud.
- You can use amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need. Confiugre security and networking and manage storage.
- Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or scale down the instance.
- Amazon EC2 is having two storage options. ie EBS (elastic block store) and instance store.
- preconfigured templates are available known as Amazon Machine Image.
- By default, when you create on EC2 account with amazon, your account is limited to a mazimum of  20 instances per EC2 regions with two default High I/O instances.

Types of EC2 Instances
1. General Purpose  --> Balanced memory and cpu
2. Compute Optimized --> More CPU than RAM 
3. Memory Optimized  --> More RAM
4. Storage Optimized --> Low Latency

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):

A virtual private cloud is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional networking that you operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable Infra-structure of AWS. 

OR

VPC is a virtual Network or Datacenter inside AWS for One client.

- It is logically Isolated from other virtual network in the AWS cloud
- Max 5 VPC can be created and 200 subnets in 1 VPC.
- WE can allocate max 5 elastic IP.
- Once we created VPC, DHCP, NACL and Security Group will be automatically created.
- A VPC is confined to an AWS region and does not extend between Regions.
- Once the VPC is createc, you cannot change its CIDR block range.
- if you need a different CIDR size, create a new VPC.
- The different Subnets within a VPC cannot overlap.
- you can however expand your VPC CIDR by adding New/Extra IP address ranges(except GovCloud & AWS China)

Components of VPC:
CIDR and IP address Subnets.
- Implied Router & Routing Table
- Internet Gateway
- Security Groups
- Network ACL (Network access control list)
- Virtual private gateway
- peering Connections
- Elastic IP

Note: 
1. NAT gateway created in Public subnet and used in private subnet.
2. Router is inside Region.
3. Internet Gateway is located in region's boundary.
----------------

VPC Types:
1. default VPC
2. custom VPC

1. Default VPC:
Created in each AWS region when account is created.
- Has default CIDR, security group, NACL and route table settings.
- Has an Internet gateway by default.

2. Custom VPC:
Is a VPC  an AWS account owner creates.
- AWS user creating the custom VPC can decide the CIDR.
- Has its own default security group, Network ACL and route tables.
- Does not have an Internet gateway by default, one needs to be created if needed.
--------------

To create VPC 4 steps to follow:
1. Create a VPC
2. Create subnet.
3. Create Internet gateway.
4. Create Route table.
---------------

Public Subnet:
If a subnet's traffic is routed to an Internet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet. If you want your instance in a public subnet to communicate with the internet over IPv4, it must have a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address.

Private Subnet:
If a subnet does not have a route to the internet gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet.
- when you create a VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the VPC. The allowed block size is between /16 to /28 netmask.
- The first four and last IP address of subnet cannot be assigned.

For eg --> 10.0.0.0 network address.
10.0.0.1 --> Reserved by AWS for the VPC route.
10.0.0.2 --> Reserved by AWS for the IP address of DNS server
10.0.0.3 --> Reserved for future use.
10.0.0.255 --> Broadcast address.

Note: AWS does not support broadcast in a VPC but reserve this address.
