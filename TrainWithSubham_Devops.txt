What is shell? (user interface) 
The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and passes them to the operating system (kernel) for performing.
During the initial days, shells was the only mode for communicating with the kernel(via the CLI).

What is BASH?
Bash is short for Bourne Again SHell. it's a replacement to the original shell(/bin/sh). Bash combines the features of the Original Shell + additional functionality to make it easier and more convenient to use.
Nowadays, BASH has been adopted as the default shell for most Linux systems.

bash default characteristics
1. command alias c=clear
2. command completion
3. command history

/etc/shells  for configration files
echo $SHELL

what are Daemons?
- A daemon is a type of program that runs in the background, free of user control.
- They can be activated( initiated as a process) by the occurance of a specific event or condition.
- Daemons accommodate service requests from tother programs or hardware activity or requests from other computer on a network.
- After the request is serviced, the Daemon disconnects and wits for furtehr requests.
ps -ef  (all the daemons in TTY)

sar -r

df -fT
ext4 & ext3 are default file systems in linux

To SSH in a machine

man-db is a helper database

ubuntu@ip-172-31-18-57:~$ sudo apt update
ubuntu@ip-172-31-18-57:~$ sudo apt install docker
----------------
copy file from local to server
1. Make a file in your local machine
2. sudo scp -i Pem_file_name <source file>  <destination path>

sending local machine to server
sudo scp -i TWS-key.pem <source file> <ubuntu@ec2ip:/home/ubuntu/folder_name

downloading from server to local
sudo scp -i TWD-key.pem <ubuntu@ec2ip:/home/ubuntu/folder_name/meri_file.txt .

Script is a single file where you write commands.
whereas in programming you write functions for application
